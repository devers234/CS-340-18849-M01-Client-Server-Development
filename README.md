How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
   
   One way I write code that is readable, maintainable and adaptable is by testing it over and over again. After I write a section of code, I like to test it to make sure things like syntax is correct and that the section of code is functional. Another thing I do is use naming conventions and comments when I need to. This allows for another person to look at the code and possibly edit it if they need to. In project one, I used CRUD to connect to a MongoDB. I again used CRUD in project two to add widgets to my dashboard. CRUD may be useful in the future because it allows for code to be reused. This can help save time in the future when working with Python. 

 How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
     
The first thing I do is break the problem down into smaller steps. This allows me to look at the problem and try to figure out how to manage it. I would use the same method I used for this project in future ones. I read and understood the requirements that Grazioso Salvare was asking for. Once I understood the requirements, I could begin on the dashboard. This approach was different because in other courses I used things like interviews and communicating with stakeholders to gather the requirements. In this course, the requirements were given to me. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  One job computer scientists do is help solve and support real world problems. In project two, Grazioso Salvare wanted to have a dashboard that displayed dogs and how they were rescued. This helps locate dogs and see what dogs can be used for rescues.
